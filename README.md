# General information

**shadPS4** is an early **PlayStation 4** emulator for **Windows**, **Linux** and **macOS** written in C++.

If you encounter problems or have doubts, do not hesitate to look at the [**Quickstart**](https://github.com/shadps4-emu/shadPS4/blob/main/documents/Quickstart/Quickstart.md).\
To verify that a game works, you can look at [**shadPS4 Game Compatibility**](https://github.com/shadps4-emu/shadps4-game-compatibility).\
To discuss shadPS4 development, suggest ideas or to ask for help, join our [**Discord server**](https://discord.gg/bFJxfftGW6).\
To get the latest news, go to our [**X (Twitter)**](https://x.com/shadps4) or our [**website**](https://shadps4.net/).\
For those who'd like to donate to the project, we now have a [**Kofi page**](https://ko-fi.com/shadps4)!

# Status

> [!IMPORTANT]
> shadPS4 is early in development, don't expect a flawless experience.

Currently, the emulator can successfully run games like [**Bloodborne**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wC6s0avpQRE), [**Dark Souls Remastered**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3PA-Xwszts), [**Red Dead Redemption**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Al7yz_5nLag) and many other games.

# Why

This project began as a fun project. Given our limited free time, it may take some time before shadPS4 can run more complex games, but we're committed to making small, regular updates.

# Building

## Windows

Check the build instructions for [**Windows**](https://github.com/shadps4-emu/shadPS4/blob/main/documents/building-windows.md).

## Linux

Check the build instructions for [**Linux**](https://github.com/shadps4-emu/shadPS4/blob/main/documents/building-linux.md).

## macOS

Check the build instructions for [**macOS**](https://github.com/shadps4-emu/shadPS4/blob/main/documents/building-macos.md).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> macOS users need at least macOS 15 on Apple Silicon-based Mac devices and at least macOS 14 on Intel-based Mac devices.

# Debugging and reporting issues

For more information on how to test, debug and report issues with the emulator or games, read the [**Debugging documentation**](https://github.com/shadps4-emu/shadPS4/blob/main/documents/Debugging/Debugging.md).

# Keyboard and Mouse Mappings

> [!NOTE]
> Xbox and DualShock controllers work out of the box.

The default controls are inspired by the *Elden Ring* PC controls. Inputs support up to three keys per binding, mouse buttons, mouse movement mapped to joystick input, and more.

| Action      | Default Key(s)              |
|-------------|-----------------------------|
| Triangle    | F                           |
| Circle      | Space                       |
| Cross       | E                           |
| Square      | R                           |
| Pad Up      | W, LAlt / Mouse Wheel Up    |
| Pad Down    | S, LAlt / Mouse Wheel Down  |
| Pad Left    | A, LAlt / Mouse Wheel Left  |
| Pad Right   | D, LAlt / Mouse Wheel Right |
| L1          | Right Button, LShift        |
| R1          | Left Button                 |
| L2          | Right Button                |
| R2          | Left Button, LShift         |
| L3          | X                           |
| R3          | Q / Middle Button          |
| Options     | Escape                      |
| Touchpad    | G                           |

| Joystick           | Default Input  |
|--------------------|----------------|
| Left Joystick      | WASD           |
| Right Joystick     | Mouse movement |

Keyboard and mouse inputs can be customized in the settings menu by clicking the Controller button, and further details and help on controls are  also found there. Custom bindings are saved per-game.

# Special Thanks

A few noteworthy teams/projects who've helped us along the way are:

- [**Panda3DS**](https://github.com/wheremyfoodat/Panda3DS): A multiplatform 3DS emulator from our co-author wheremyfoodat. They have been incredibly helpful in understanding and solving problems that came up from natively executing the x64 code of PS4 binaries

- [**fpPS4**](https://github.com/red-prig/fpPS4): The fpPS4 team has assisted massively with understanding some of the more complex parts of the PS4 operating system and libraries, by helping with reverse engineering work and research.

- **yuzu**: Our shader compiler has been designed with yuzu's Hades compiler as a blueprint. This allowed us to focus on the challenges of emulating a modern AMD GPU while having a high-quality optimizing shader compiler implementation as a base.

- [**hydra**](https://github.com/hydra-emu/hydra): A multisystem, multiplatform emulator (chip-8, GB, NES, N64) from Paris.
